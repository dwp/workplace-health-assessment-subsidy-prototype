    <p class="govuk-body">
      This website is run by the Government Digital Service. It is designed to be used by as many people as possible. The text should be clear and simple to understand. You should be able to:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without problems</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>

      <li>use most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>

      How accessible is this website
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">

    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you cannot modify the line height or spacing of text</li>
      <li>most older PDF documents are not fully accessible to screen reader software</li>
      <li>live video streams do not have captions</li>
      <li>you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader</li>
      <li>there’s a limit to how far you can magnify the map on our ‘contact us’ page</li>

      Technical information about this website’s accessibility
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The Government Digital Service is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
      >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
    </h3>
    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>Some tables in content do not have table row headers when needed. This means assistive technologies will not read the tables correctly. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
      <li>Images on some pages do not always have suitable image descriptions. Users of assistive technologies may not have access to information conveyed in images. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).</li>
      <li>Some pages have duplicate titles. This may make it difficult for users to orient themselves and find the right content. This fails WCAG 2.4.2 success criterion (Page Titled).</li>
      <li>The change in the default written language is not correctly identified on some pages. This means screen readers will not read content correctly. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.1.2 (Language of Parts).</li>
      <li>Translation Navigation is inconsistently named. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.4 (Consistent Identification).</li>
      <li>Some pages cannot be found through more than one type of navigation. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.5 (Multiple Ways).</li>
      <li>Some pages have inconsistently-placed language navigation. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.2.4 success criterion (Consistent Identification).</li>
      <li>Some content look like headings but are not. This makes it difficult for screen reader users to navigate the page. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
      <li>Some pages have poor colour contrast. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1 (Use of Colour).</li>
      <li>Many documents are in less accessible formats, for example PDF. Non-HTML documents published on or after 23 September 2018 must have an accessible format.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      PDFs and non-HTML documents
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Many documents are not accessible in a number of ways including missing text alternatives and missing document structure.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Disproportionate burden
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We believe that fixing the accessibility problems with some content would be disproportionate because the relevant platform will be retired soon.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Applying for licences
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some of the content used to apply for some types of licence is non-accessible. For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/temporary-events-notice">applying for a Temporary Events Notice</a>:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>adjacent links to the same pages mean it’s not easy to navigate using keyboard alone - this fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard)</li>
      <li>some forms controls are not detectable by screen reader software - this fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)</li>
      <li>some pages are missing a heading - this fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The non-accessible content used to apply for some types of licence is published through platforms which we are transitioning to new arrangements. We believe that fixing the problems causing content to be non-accessible on the old platforms would be disproportionate.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Non-HTML documents published before September 2018 do not need to be accessible - unless users need them to use a service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">
      How we tested this website
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA to test how accessible GOV.UK is.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We used the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) approach to decide on a sample of pages to test.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We also tested a sample of pages involved in applying for licences.
      In April 2022, the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) conducted an audit of a representative sample of pages on GOV.UK, from which common accessibility issues across the website were identified.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">
      What we’re doing to improve accessibility
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Following the audit conducted by the DAC in April 2022, departments and agencies are urgently fixing content which fails to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.
    </p>
