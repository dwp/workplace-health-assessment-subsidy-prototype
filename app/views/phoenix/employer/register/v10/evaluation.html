      <p>
        Each workplace health provider will need to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>  provide evidence that at least Â one healthcare professional has a qualification in occupational health</li>
<li>agree to a declaration about the service they will provide  </li>

</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Evidence</h2>

<p>We ask for evidence of healthcare provider professionals' qualifications and registration numbers.
</p>
<p>A registration number ensures that a healthcare professional is fit to practise.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Declarations</h2>

<p>Each workplace health provider has declared their service has:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>clinical governance</li>
<li>complaints procedures</li>
<li>feedback opportunities</li>
<li>data management policies</li>
<li>referral pathways </li>
</ul>
