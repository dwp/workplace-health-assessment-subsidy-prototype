  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="what-is-a-workplace-health-assessment"></a> What is a workplace health assessment</h2>

  <p>If an employee is finding it difficult to work because of their health, they can get a workplace health assessment. </p>
  <p>Workplace health assessments are sometimes called occupational health or vocational rehabilitation assessments.</p>
  <p>A workplace health assessment is different from a doctor's report. </p>
  <p>It focuses on an employee’s work environment and how their job might affect their health. </p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    A workplace health professional will not diagnose health conditions or disabilities. They will give advice and recommend onward support for an employee's health at work. 
  </div>

  <p>The employee may have: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a mental health condition, for example anxiety or depression</li>
<li>a physical health condition like diabetes or arthritis </li>
<li>an injury, such as a broken leg </li>
<li>an impairment or physical disability, such as blindness </li>
<li>a learning disability, for example Down's syndrome</li>
<li>a learning difficultly like dyslexia</li>
<li>a neurodivergence like autism or ADHD</li>
<li>another condition, disability or illness that might affect their ability to do their job</li>
      </ul>




  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens during a workplace health assessment</h3>
<p>An assessment can be remote or in person. </p>
<p>During the assessment, a workplace health professional will ask an employee about: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>their health and any treatment they're having</li>
<li>their usual and expected work activities  </li>
<li>their general lifestyle and activities outside work  </li>
<li>who is already involved in supporting their health </li>

      </ul>

<p>The conversation is impartial and confidential. </p>
<p>The employee's medical details will not be shared without their consent. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens after a workplace health assessment</h3>
<p>The workplace health professional will write a report. </p>
<p>The report will contain advice and recommendations, which could include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>adjustments to an employee's workspace, such as a bigger screen or adjustable chair</li>
<li>a phased return to work or different working hours </li>
<li>a referral to other services, like physiotherapy or mental health support  </li>
<li>guidance on free and paid-for services employers could use to support an employee </li>
<li>help for employers about keeping to health and safety regulations </li>
<li>links to other organisations who may be able to help </li>

      </ul>
<p>After the report has been sent, the employer and employee should discuss if any adjustments are needed.  </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The law on reasonable adjustments </h3>

<p>By law, you must make changes if you know, or could be expected to know, that your employee is disabled. These are called reasonable adjustments. </p>
<p><a href="#">Find out when you must make reasonable adjustments on the Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) website (opens in a new tab).  </a></p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Help with costs from Access to Work</h3>

<p>If adjustments are more expensive than is reasonable for you, your employee can <a href="#">apply to Access to Work (opens in new tab)</a> to help with the costs. </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="using-workplace-health-assessments"></a>Using workplace health assessments to support an employee </h2>

<p>Employees can ask you to refer them for a workplace health assessment. </p>

<p>You can also ask an employee if they'll agree to an assessment. This might happen if: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>there's been a change in how they're performing at work </li>
<li>they've been absent more often than normal </li>
<li>they're off sick for more than 4 weeks  </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits to an employee </h3>
      <p>An assessment can help an employee: 
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>return to work </li>
      <li>get expert advice</li>
      <li>get any support they might need   </li>
            </ul>

<p> 
  If your employee does not agree to an assessment, remind them that they do not need to share information about their health with you.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits to your business </h3>

  <p>Assessments help you understand how to support your employee’s health at work. This could help save you money in the future by: 
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>reducing absences </li>
  <li>increasing productivity  </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="how-the-discount-works"></a> How the discount scheme works  </h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to use the discount code  </h3>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li><a href="#">Check if your business is eligible</a>  and get a discount code. </li>
          <li>Search the list of providers.</li>
          <li>CContact a provider to book an assessment. </li>
          <li>Give the provider your discount code. </li>
          <li>After the assessment, you will get advice about free or funded onward support for your employee. </li>
          <li>Pay the provider when they invoice you. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need another discount code  </h3>

<p>You can use this scheme for all employees, including yourself. </p>

<p>Employees can have more assessments for ongoing or new cases. </p>
<p>For every assessment, you will need to get a new discount code by answering the eligibility questions again. </p>
<p>Discount codes do not expire. </p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What an assessment will cost  </h3>
<p>An assessment will cost between £20 and £80 after the 80% discount. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why the cost of assessments differ </h3>
<p>The cost can be different depending on: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the complexity of the case  </li>
<li>the type of health care professional that does the assessment </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text"> <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples</h3>
        Sam has a video call assessment with a nurse. It cost £150, so his employer pays £30. 
        <p>Emma has a video call with an occupational therapist. It cost £250, so her employer pays £50.</p>
      </div>

 

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If an employee needs to cancel or reschedule an assessment  </h3>
<p>Cancellation or rescheduling of an assessment might result in a fee. </p>

<p>You need to check with the workplace health provider what their policy is. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If an employee does not attend an assessment </h3>

<p>You will have to pay for the full cost of an assessment if your employee does not attend. </p>
<p>Reassuring and reminding your employee about the assessment process means they are more likely to attend. </p>
