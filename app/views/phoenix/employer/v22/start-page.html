<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h2>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can use this service to get a code for an 80% discount of the cost of a workplace health assessment for employees.</p>

<p>An assessment will cost between £20 and £80, after the discount.</p>

{# <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    You will be able to use this service to <a href="/phoenix/employer/register/v11/list-filters-mvp-anonymised">search for a private sector workplace health provider</a> to carry out the assessment.
</div> #}

<p>The assesssment will help you understand what support your employee needs to stay in, or return to work.</p>
<p>Supporting an employee’s health and wellbeing may reduce the amount of time they need to take off work. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pilot phase</h2>
    <p>During the pilot phase SMEs in Cumbria, Lancashire and Barrow-in-Furness have been invited to take part. </p>
    <p>The pilot phase will be running from early 2024 for a number of months, after which we will open up the service to more employers.  
        If your organisation does not fit the <a href="eligibility">eligibility for the pilot</a> you can register your interest by emailing <a href="mailto:workplacehealth.employer@dwp.gov.uk">workplacehealth.employer@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>
