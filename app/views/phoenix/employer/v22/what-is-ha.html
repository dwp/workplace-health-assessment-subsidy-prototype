  <p>Workplace health assessments are also known as occupational health assessments. They can include fitness for work questionnaires, return to work assessments or management referrals.</p>
  <p>An assessment focuses on an employee’s work environment. It looks at how their job might affect their health or how their health may impact their work.</p>
  <p>An assessment could include a discussion about an employee’s:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>health and work activities</li>
        <li>return to work plans</li>
        <li>workplace adjustments</li>
        <li>onward support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="what-happens-during-a-workplace-health-assessment"></a> What happens during a workplace health assessment</h2>

    <p>An assessment can be remote or in person.</p>
    <p>During the assessment, a workplace health professional will ask an employee about:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their health and any treatment they're having</li>
        <li>their usual and expected work activities</li>
        <li>their general lifestyle and activities outside work</li>
        <li>who is already involved in supporting their health</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The conversation is impartial and confidential.</p>
    <p>The employee's medical details will not be shared without their consent.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="what-happens-after-a-workplace-health-assessment"></a> What happens after a workplace health assessment</h2>

    <p>The workplace health professional will write a report.</p>
    <p>The report will contain advice and recommendations, which could include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>adjustments to an employee's workspace, such as a bigger screen or adjustable chair</li>
        <li>a phased return to work or different working hours</li>
        <li>a referral to other services, like physiotherapy or mental health support</li>
        <li>guidance on free and paid-for services employers could use to support an employee</li>
        <li>help for employers about keeping to health and safety regulations</li>
        <li>links to other organisations who may be able to help</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After the report has been sent, the employer and employee should discuss if any adjustments are needed.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="the-law-on-reasonable-adjustments"></a> The law on reasonable adjustments</h2>

    <p>By law, you must make changes if you know, or could be expected to know, that your employee is disabled. These are called reasonable adjustments.</p>
    <p>Find out when you must <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-mental-health">make reasonable adjustments on the Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) website</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="help-with-costs-from-access-to-work"></a> Help with costs from Access to Work</h2>

    <p>If adjustments are more expensive than is reasonable for you, your employee <a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">can apply to Access to Work</a> to help with the costs.</p>
