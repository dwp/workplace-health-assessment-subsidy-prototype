  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to use the discount code</h2>


<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li><a href="are-you-eligible">Check if your business is eligible </a>and get a discount code.</li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>
  <li>Search the list of providers.</li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>
  <li>Contact a provider to book an assessment. </li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>
  <li>Give the provider your discount code.</li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>
  <li>After the assessment, you will get advice about free or funded onward support for your employee.</li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>
  <li>Pay the provider when they invoice you. </li>
  <div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-2"></div>

</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you need another discount code</h2>
<p>You can use this scheme for all employees, including yourself.</p>

<p>Employees can have more assessments for ongoing or new cases. </p>
<p>For every assessment, you will need to get a new discount code by answering the eligibility questions again. </p>


<p>Discount codes do not expire.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> What an assessment will cost </h2>

<p>An assessment will cost between £20 and £80 after the 80% discount.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> Why the cost of assessments differ </h2>
<p>The cost can be different depending on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<li>the complexity of the case</li>
<li>the type of health care professional that does the assessment</li>
</ul>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">  Examples</p>

<p>Sam has a video call assessment with a nurse. It costs £150, so his employer pays £30.
</p>
<p>Emma has an video call with an occupational therapist. It costs £250, so her employer pays £50.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If an employee needs to cancel or reschedule an assessment</h2>
<p>Cancellation or rescheduling of an assessment might result in a fee.</p>
<p>You need to check with the workplace health provider what their cancellation policy is.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If an employee does not attend an assessment</h2>
<p>You will have to pay for the full cost of an assessment if your employee does not attend.</p>
<p>Reassuring and reminding your employee about the assessment process means they are more likely to attend.</p>
