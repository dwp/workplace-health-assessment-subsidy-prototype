<p>This service is primarily for employers. </p>

<p>However, there is also <a href="/phoenix/employee/v3/guide-page">advice for employees about how to get expert health support at work. </a>.</p>


      <p>Employers can use this service to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>get an 80% discount code to help pay for a workplace health assessment for an employee</li>
<li><a href="/phoenix/employer/register/v6/page-1">search for a private sector workplace health provider to do the assessment</a></li>
</ul>


  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What a workplace health assessment provides </h2>
<p>You should consider an assessment for an employee if they're finding it difficult to work because of their health. This could include:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>their mental or physical health</li>
<li>an injury, such as a broken leg </li>
<li>a long-term health condition</li>
<li>an impairment or physical disability  </li>
<li>a learning disability, for example ADHD or autism</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a general list of health situations. If you’re unsure whether a specific health concern is a workplace health matter, you should discuss this when you contact a provider about doing a workplace health assessment.   </p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
A workplace health professional will not diagnose health conditions or disabilities. They will give advice and recommend onward support for an employee's health at work.
</div>
<p>
After the assessment, you and your employee will get a report with advice. This can help you understand what support they need to stay in or return to work. This could include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>advice on any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers"> reasonable adjustments</a> you could make </li>
<li>guidance on free and paid-for changes you could make to support them</li>
<li>links to other organisations who may be able to help </li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="how-assess-works">guidance on how a workplace health assessment works</a>.
</p>
