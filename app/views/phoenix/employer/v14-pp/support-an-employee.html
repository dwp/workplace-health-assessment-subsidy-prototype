<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="using-workplace-health-assessments"></a>Using workplace health assessments to support an employee </h2>

<p>Employees can ask you to refer them for a workplace health assessment. </p>

<p>You can also ask an employee if they'll agree to an assessment. This might happen if: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>there's been a change in how they're performing at work </li>
<li>they've been absent more often than normal </li>
<li>they're off sick for more than 4 weeks  </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits to an employee </h3>
      <p>An assessment can help an employee: 
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>return to work </li>
      <li>get expert advice</li>
      <li>get any support they might need   </li>
            </ul>

<p> 
  If your employee does not agree to an assessment, remind them that they do not need to share information about their health with you.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits to your business </h3>
  <p>Assessments help you understand how to support your employee’s health at work. This could help save you money in the future by: 
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>reducing absences </li>
  <li>increasing productivity</li>
 
        </ul>
