<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="how-the-discount-works"></a> How the discount scheme works  </h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to use the discount code  </h3>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li><a href="apply">Check if your business is eligible</a>  and get a discount code. </li>
  <li>Search the list of providers.</li>
  <li>Contact a provider to book an assessment. </li>
  <li>Give the provider your discount code. </li>
  <li>After the assessment, you will get advice about free or funded onward support for your employee. </li>
  <li>Pay the provider when they invoice you. </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need another discount code  </h3>

<p>You can use this scheme for all employees, including yourself. </p>

<p>Employees can have more assessments for ongoing or new cases. </p>
<p>For every assessment, you will need to get a new discount code by answering the eligibility questions again. </p>
<p>Discount codes do not expire. </p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What an assessment will cost  </h3>
<p>An assessment will cost between £20 and £80 after the 80% discount. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why the cost of assessments differ </h3>
<p>The price can be different depending on: 
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the complexity of the case  </li>
<li>the type of health care professional that does the assessment </li>
</ul>

<div class="govuk-inset-text"> <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Examples</h3>
<p> Sam has a video call assessment with a nurse. It cost £150, so his employer pays £30. </p>
<p>Emma has a an in-person assessment with an occupational therapist. It cost £250, so her employer pays £50.</p>
</div>



<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If an employee needs to cancel or reschedule an assessment  </h3>
<p>Cancelling or rescheduling an assessment might result in a fee. </p>

<p>You need to check with the workplace health provider what their policy is. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If an employee does not attend an assessment </h3>

<p>You will have to pay for the full cost of an assessment if your employee does not attend. </p>
<p>Reassuring and reminding your employee about the assessment process means they are more likely to attend. </p>
