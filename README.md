Instructions to push changes into the Heroku prototype: 
1. In your IDE e.g. VS Code, create a separate branch for each ticket by its ticket number in the format f-phn-TICKETNUMBER e.g. f-phn-1234
2. Publish the branch (if it's a new ticket/branch)
3. Stage your changes, write a message describing the change and commit.
4. Push your commit
5. Open Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/dwp/health/workplace-health-assessment-subsidy/prototypes/prototype-workplace-health-assessment-subsidy), you will see 'Create merge request' (with your ticket number/branch) at the top of the screen and in 'Merge requests' when you click into it from the left navigation panel. Create the merge request and leave the default settings as they are in the 'New merge request' page. Create the merge request.
6. Copy and paste the merge request URL into the health-design-team Slack channel. You will need to get added to by Ladine Cook LADINE.COOK@DWP.GOV.UK 
7. Once the request is approved by 2 approvers, you will see the changes updated onto the Heroku prototype. In the meantime, you can screenshot the iterated design from your Localhost:3000 and upload to your ticket.
